# Duolingo Monetization & Revenue Insights using Tableau
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of user engagement and monetization patterns across different subscription tiers (Free, Basic, Premium) and courses (English, Spanish, German, etc.) in the context of a language learning application (similar to Duolingo). The goal is to uncover key insights into user behavior and revenue generation, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to enhance user retention and maximize monetization strategies.

The analysis is presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, which visualizes key metrics such as in-app purchases, active minutes, ad impressions, and course preferences. These insights help to identify high-value user segments and optimize revenue streams.
